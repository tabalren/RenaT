## Risky Business 

### Part 1 - Resampling Techniques 

#### The following script will use the imbalanced learn library to build and evaluate logistic regression classifiers to assess credit risk. Please refer to .ipynb files for the detailed, step-by-step code. Below will outline the high level summary of results for each model. 

### Simple Logistic Regression

### Oversampling Algorithms 
#### Two oversampling algorithms (1. Naive Random Oversampling and 2. SMOTE Oversampling) were used to determine which algorithm results in the best performance. 

#### 1. Naive Random Oversampling Results 

#### 2. SMOTE Oversampling Results 


### Undersampling
#### Now an undersampling algorithm was tested to determine which algorithm results in the best performance compared to the oversampling algorithms above. The Cluster Centroids algorithm was used. 

#### Cluster Centroids Undersamping Algorithm Results

### Combination (Over and Under) Sampling
#### Now a combination of over- and under-sampling algorithm was used to determine if the algorithm results in the best performance compared to the other sampling algorithms above. 

#### SMOTEEN Over and Under Algorithm Results


### Part 1 - Final Questions

#### Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?

The combination over- and under-sampling algorithm resulted in the best balanced accuracy score = 99.5%.

#### Which model had the best recall score? 

The combination over- and under-sampling algorithm resulted in the best recall score = 100%.

#### Which model had the best geometric mean score? 

The combination over- and under-sampling algorithm resulted in the best geometric mean score = 100%.
