## Risky Business 
#### The following script will use the imbalanced learn library to build and evaluate logistic regression classifiers using the resampled data to assess credit risk. Please refer to .ipynb files for the detailed, step-by-step code. Below will outline the high level summary of results for each model. 

### Simple Logistic Regression

### Oversampling Algorithms 
#### Now we will compare two oversampling algorithms (1. Naive Random Oversampling and 2. SMOTE Oversampling) to determine which algorithm results in the best performance.
